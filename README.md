# fuzzyl
Fuzzy logic is one of the pillars of computational intelligence, and is most often used to deal with complex and incomplete processes, where traditional artificial intelligence, which requires exact knowledge, struggles to find meaningful answers. Because it works so well with incompleteness, fuzzy logic is already widespread when it comes to its applications, and it can be found in systems that range from image processing applications to washing machines. However, for this project, fuzzy inference was chosen as the main subject of interest because of its impact on approximate reasoning.

The main library used for this project is **SciKit-Fuzzy**, which is available here: https://github.com/scikit-fuzzy/scikit-fuzzy. Other dependencies of this project include:

* NumPy (1.19.5);
* NetworkX (2.5, implicit).
